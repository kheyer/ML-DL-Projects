    "# Toxic Comment Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based off Lesson 3 of fast.ai - creating a text classification model using the [ULMFiT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.06146.pdf) method. ULMFiT uses a three stage training protocol to create a text classification model.\n",
    " 1. First a language model is trained on a large text corpus\n",
    " 2. The language model is fine tuned on the classification corpus to create a fine tuned language model\n",
    " 3. The fine tuned language model is used as the basis of the final classification model\n",
    " \n",
    "What's the logic behind this approach? Lets break down each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental assumption in ULMFiT is that classifying text samples requires an understanding of the language the texts are written in. This is in contrast to more traditional classification techniques like bag of word and text frequency approaches, which focus more on word frequency. The foundation of a ULMFiT model is a language model trained to understand the language underlying the classification task. Language understanding is measured using accuracy - the ability for the model to correctly predict the next word in an input string. There are a lot of ways to measure understanding of a language. Accuracy may not be the perfect metric, but for the purpose of evaluating the model's language ability it seems to function well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the language model can be trained on text data outside the classification data. If we trust the assumption that language understanding is key to text classification, we want to train the language model on the largest, most representative corpus available. The base language model used in this notebook is an english language model trained on the [WikiText-103](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fine Tuned Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a specialized language model that understands the english language in general, we want to specialize it to the specific text corpus we want to work with. In this case we're looking at the [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) dataset. We expect the dataset we're actually working with to contain learnable domain information that would not be present in the general WikiText-103 dataset. Maybe particular words or sentence structures are noticeable in the dataset. For example in the Quora dataset, every text input is a question. We might also want to update the vocabulary of the model to reflect word frequency distributions in the classification dataset. Fine tuning the language model to the classification corpus helps optimize the language model for task specific features of the classification dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "During fine tuning, we train the model using discriminative learning rates. Earlier layers in the model are trained at a lower learning rate than the later layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a fine tuned language model, we can create the classification model. This involves adding a new linear layer to the language model that outputs predictions for the number of classes in the dataset. We train this model using both discriminative learning rate and gradual unfreezing. This means firstly that most of the training goes towards the new linear layer - we assume the language features extracted by the language model layers are well tuned. We also freeze most of the model at the start of training, and gradually unfreeze layers as training progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "The text data needs to be converted to a numerical form before being sent to the model. We accomplish this in two steps - tokenizing and numericalizing the text. Tokenization breaks up strings into word level tokens. fastai defaults to using [Spacy](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer) to tokenize text. Tokenization breaks down compound words, for example tokenizing `don't` into `do 'nt`. Tokenizing also adds elements of sentence structure. Each sentence starts with a `xxbos` token. Capitalized letters are denoted with a token - `Here` becomes `xxmaj here`. This way, we can retain the information contained in the capitalization without having to  track multiple versions of a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we tokenize, we also decide what the vocabulary of the model will be. It's not computationally feasible to train a model using every single word in the english language. We select a vocabulary of the 60000 most used words in the text corpus, and replace all other words with a `<unk>` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once text has been tokenized, we can numericalize text by mapping each token to a numerical id. This converts text strings to a vector of numbers that can be consumed by a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The models we use for all stages of the ULMFiT process follow the same structure, based off the approach taken in [Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182.pdf). The first layer is an embedding layer which converts words to vectors. Then there are three stacked LSTM layers, followed by a linear output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](lstm1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding layer converts discrete words to higher dimensional vector representation. The models in this notebook use vectors of length 400 to represent words. The embedding functions as a lookup table for every word in the model's vocabulary. The embedding matrix can be one of the most memory intensive aspects of the model. This is why the size of the model's vocabulary has a strong effect on the compute cost of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the text data is in vector form, it will be processed by three stacked LSTM modules. LSTMs are a slightly more complex variant of RNNs. Traditional RNNs process sequential data by building up a hidden state that is passed from one input to the next. A standard RNN in pytorch follows the function \n",
    "\n",
    "$h_t = tanh(w_{ih} x_t + b_{ih}  +  w_{hh} h_{(t-1)} + b_{hh})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_t$ is the current input vector and $h_{(t-1)}$ is the previous hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTMs take this a step further by traking two states - the hidden state $h_t$ and the cell state $c_t$. Several gating functions are used to control the flow of information through the LSTM. The equations governing LSTMs are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "i_t = \\sigma(W_{ii} x_t + b_{ii} + W_{hi} h_{(t-1)} + b_{hi}) \\\\\n",
    "f_t = \\sigma(W_{if} x_t + b_{if} + W_{hf} h_{(t-1)} + b_{hf}) \\\\\n",
    "g_t = \\tanh(W_{ig} x_t + b_{ig} + W_{hg} h_{(t-1)} + b_{hg}) \\\\\n",
    "o_t = \\sigma(W_{io} x_t + b_{io} + W_{ho} h_{(t-1)} + b_{ho}) \\\\\n",
    "c_t = f_t c_{(t-1)} + i_t g_t \\\\\n",
    "h_t = o_t \\tanh(c_t)\n",
    "\\end{array}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_{t}$ is the input gate. This controls how much of the new input is taken into the cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f_{t}$ is the forget gate. This gate controls how much of the old cell state passes on to the new cell state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$g_{t}$ is the cell gate, which is the same equation we used to define our new hidden state in the standard RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "$o_{t}$ is the output gate which controls how much of the cell state passes on to the hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{t}$ is the current cell state. You will notice $c_{t}$ is composed of the old cell state, the current forget gate, the current input gate, and the current cell gate. This shows how the various gates are used to filter how much of the input and previous cell state pass on to the new hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "$h_{t}$ is the new hidden state. It is composed of the current cell state activated by $tanh$ and filtered by the output gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights involved in the different LSTM functions allow the network to learn to control the flow of information when processing a sequence - namely when to keep old information and when to throw it away.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is regularized by applying dropout at several stages - on word vectors after the embedding, on the outputs between LSTM layers, on the output of the final LSTM layer, and on the final linear layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained with Cross Entropy loss"

These three output vectors are then concatenated together to form a single 1x1200 vector. This is what is actually sent to the final linear layers."
