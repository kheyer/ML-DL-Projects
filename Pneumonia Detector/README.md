# Pneumonia Detector

In this project I take a single shot detection model I used for a [previous project](https://github.com/kheyer/ML-DL-Projects/tree/master/Single%20Shot%20Detector) to
 detect pneumonia in medical imaging. The model is based off the paper [SSD: Single Shot Multibox Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf) by Liu et al. and 
 trained using focal loss as detained in [Focal loss for Dense Ojbect Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02002.pdf).
